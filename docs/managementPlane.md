The Management Plane, centered around the UnoPlat CLI (Command Line Interface), is designed to provide SaaS builders with a unified and simplified control mechanism for their projects. This CLI is a crucial tool, enabling builders to instruct, configure, and manage various aspects of the UnoPlat environment efficiently. Its importance lies in its simplicity and comprehensive control capabilities, which are pivotal for streamlining administrative and development tasks. The Administration Plane, therefore, plays a vital role in enhancing the user experience by facilitating easy engagement and effective management of the SaaS building process on UnoPlat.
